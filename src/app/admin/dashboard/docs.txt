Dashboard improvements summary (English)

What we implemented in this iteration
- Full-screen admin dashboard layout with responsive mobile UX (no boxed container).
- Toolbar with filters (map, action, text) and an Add New Video toggle.
- Upload form with progress, validation, and clear feedback states.
- Video table with: inline preview, badges (map and action), tags as chips, and action buttons (edit/delete) with icons.
- Loading skeletons, empty-state illustration, and global success/error banners.
- Pagination with Firestore (limit + startAfter) and a Load more button.
- Custom confirmation dialog for deletions (no browser confirm).
- Better spacing and visual polish for action buttons.
- Centered “Sign out to Home” button with helper text and redirect.
- Logout flow fix to prevent redirecting to the login page when signing out to home.
- Theming enhancements: borders, subtle shadows, badge colors per action.
- Translated admin UI to English to match the home page.

Why this matters
- Faster, clearer management of content by admins with better feedback and discoverability.
- Scales better with pagination and a cleaner layout.
- Safer operations with a clear confirmation step and improved logout flow.

Next ideas (nice-to-have)
- Column sorting and inline edits in the table.
- Server-side filtering with Firestore indices for large datasets.
- Thumbnails and media metadata (duration, resolution).
- Bulk actions and saved filters per admin.
- KPIs at the top and basic analytics for search terms.
